Blackjack Bot - Simple Feature List and Flow
🎯 Objective:
A group chat Blackjack bot where players bet against the bot (house). The bot deals cards, manages bets, and takes a percentage (rake) of each winning pot.

🌟 Feature List:
Join Game:

Command: /join <buy-in amount>

Players buy in to enter the game. Funds are held by the bot.

Start Round:

Command: /start (Triggered by the host or bot admin)

Bot announces the start of the game and deals two cards to each player and itself (1 card face up, 1 card face down).

Betting Round:

Command: /bet <amount>

Players place their bets. The amount is subtracted from their balance and added to the pot.

Player Actions:

Commands: /hit, /stand

Players choose to hit or stand. The bot sends a new card for each hit and keeps track of player totals.

Dealer’s Turn:

The bot reveals its hidden card and follows basic blackjack strategy (hit until 17 or higher).

Determine Winners:

Bot compares player hands to its hand.

Players who beat the bot receive double their bet (minus rake).

Players who tie receive their bet back (minus rake).

Payout and Rake Collection:

Bot collects a percentage (e.g., 5%) of the total pot as the rake.

Remaining pot is distributed to winners.

Game Reset:

Players can /leave or /join the next round.

✅ Edge Cases & Considerations:
Handling ties and multiple winners.

Auto-stand if a player takes too long to respond.

Ensuring transparency with pot distribution and rake collection.

Preventing players from betting more than their balance.

Handling blackjack (21) as a special case (e.g., 1.5x payout).
